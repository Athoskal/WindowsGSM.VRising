# Configuring your V Rising Server
Now comes the fun part, setting up your V Rising game server to your liking.

To modify game server settings you can create two files

ServerHostSettings.json
ServerGameSettings.json
You can create these files in your VRisingServer\Settings folder

You can modify settings in here (in addition to the launch line) - these settings overwrite your launch line settings:

ServerHostSettings.json

{

"Name" : "My V Rising Server",

"Description" : "This is a role playing server",

"Port" : 27015,

"QueryPort" : 27016,

"MaxConnectedUsers" : 10,

"MaxConnectedAdmins" : 4,

"SaveName" : "world1",

"Password" : "SuperSecret",

"ListOnMasterServer" : true,

"AutoSaveCount" : 40,

"AutoSaveInterval" : 120,

"GameSettingsPreset" : "StandardPvP"

}
